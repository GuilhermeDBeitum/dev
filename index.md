Hello, Iâ€™m Guilherme, systems developer for the web. Front and back. Committed to the service to be performed, executing in the best possible way, I always use good logical reasoning, to try to carry out deployments without leaving errors. Proactive, I'm always trying to improve the work environment. I have experience with computers, systems and spreadsheets. I work with my Xpointer system, for Raspberry cards, I maintain computers (hardware and software) and, for a long time, I am a freelance WebDev.
